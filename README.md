## An analysis of the Salt Lake County Library's Summer Reading Program

Stopping the Slide was my Program Evaluation (PUBPL6563) final project in Spring 2022. We partnered with the Salt Lake County Library to study why participation in the Summer Reading Program (SRP) decreased by nearly 50% between 2019 and 2021. 

SRPs play a critical role in preventing the "summer slide", in which low-income students tend to lose ground on the academic gains made throughout the regular school year because of lesser engagement with educational materials throughout the summer compared to their more affluent peers. The library plays a key role in preventing this slide from occurring.

The hypotheses we tested as to what influenced the decline in SRP participation included:
- Mobility differences due to the COVID-19 pandemic
- Changes in SRP-related school outreach
- Increased staff turnover due to the Great Reshuffle
- The digital divide, or lack of access to computer and Internet

Demographic data on computer and Internet access in homes was obtained from the American Community Survey. A spatial mapping procedure was utilized in which demographic data was aggregated for tracts within a 2-mile radius of each library branch. All other data was obtained from the Library, and linear models were fit to determine which factors were most influential in the SRP decline.
